 Forecasting Climate Change Using Machine Learning on  Global Emissions, Land Use, and Demographic Data

 Climate change is a serious global problem mainly caused by human actions such as burning fossil fuels, industrial activities, deforestation, and growing population. Predicting future temperature changes is important for developing climate policies and sustainable planning. This study explores how machine learning (ML) models can be used to predict global temperature trends using data on CO₂ emissions, land use, farming activities, and population statistics from multiple countries over several years.
Both regression and classification models were tested. Basic models like Linear Regression and Decision Trees were compared with more advanced models such as Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), which showed better accuracy. For classification, temperature levels were grouped into Low, Medium, and High, and models like K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest were used. Performance was measured using standard evaluation metrics.
To address the problem of class imbalance, SMOTE and other resampling methods were implemented. Contributing factors for the increase in temperatures were found to be deforestation, emissions from fertilizer usage, industrial CO₂ emissions, and growth in urban population. Methods of unsupervised learning such as clustering and PCA were employed to group countries with similar emission profiles.
These results demonstrate that machine learning can assist in providing accurate temperature forecasts and pinpoint the key drivers of climate change. This method can facilitate more informed policymaking and stimulate focused climate initiatives in various areas.
